        Chennai is a coastal city known for its deep cultural roots and calm lifestyle. It is famous for Marina Beach, ancient
        temples, classical Carnatic music, and traditional dance forms like Bharatanatyam. The city also has a strong love for
        simple and healthy food such as idli, dosa, sambar, and filter coffee.
